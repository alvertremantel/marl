//! Data output module — records simulation state to CSV files.
//!
//! This module writes two kinds of output:
//!
//! 1. **ticks.csv** — one row per simulation tick with population-level summary
//!    statistics (population count, average energy, enzyme levels, spatial
//!    distribution by z-layer, etc.). Appended every tick.
//!
//! 2. **Periodic snapshots** — detailed per-cell and per-voxel chemistry dumps
//!    written at configurable intervals:
//!    - `chem_<tick>.csv`  — z-layer-averaged chemical concentrations
//!    - `cells_<tick>.csv` — full dump of every living cell's state
//!
//! All output uses plain CSV with headers. No external crate dependencies —
//! just `std::fs` and `std::io`. BufWriter is used for performance so that
//! thousands of small writes don't each trigger a syscall.
